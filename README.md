# Why is it uploaded
So that others can learn from this map and hopefully fix something or improve in their own Vivify maps.

Nearly all assets were created by me. The sky was made by [n-yoda](https://github.com/n-yoda/unity-skybox-shaders).

You can reuse all assets in this project in your own projects.
